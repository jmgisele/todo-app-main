## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sortable.js
- Semantic and Accessible HTML
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB

### What I learned
I decided to come back to this app after a few months and re-make it with persistent storage! I did my best to make the form accessible via keyboard as well, as I was less experienced when I coded this originally and wasn't aware of best practices. Storage is handled client-side using the IDB. This is my first project using client-side storage other than basic cookies/session, so it was a good easy way to test stuff out.

### Useful resources

- [abhik-b's solution](https://github.com/abhik-b/frontend-challenge-3) - was very helpful in figuring out Sortable.js, which I'd never used before!
- [Here is SortableJS](https://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/), which is what I used to create the drag-and-drop functionality.
- [The MDN Client-side storage guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Client-side_storage) conveniently used an example of a todo app.
